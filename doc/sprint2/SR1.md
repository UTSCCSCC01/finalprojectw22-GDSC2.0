# Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting
- Sahib Nanda
- Dale Rodrigues
- Litao Chen
- Vishay Singh
- Stephan Motha
- Ahmed Al-Mandalawi

## Unfinished Tasks
- [GD-6] As a site admin, I want a log of all activity that occurs on the platform and any errors to be reported via email 

> Litao Chen: "GD-6 has not started in Sprint 1 due to the stakeholders' preference of using the docker container for the project. Originally assigned time on this task has been shifted to GD-30 docker task."

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Meeting on discord calls to debug code outside of standup meetings
- Having other memebers review pull requests before merging to master 
- Have multiple members working on subtasks under the same Jira task to complete the work more effectively and efficiently

## New Practices To Use
- More standup meetings to get a better understanding of where each member is at for their respective task
- Working on tasks more frequently at designated times throughout the week

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Should work on documentation as we progress through the sprint, rather than at the end of the sprint

## Best/Worst Experiences 
- Best experience was being able to create a frontend with good UX and a proper functional backend to showcase in the demos
- Worst experience was demoing our documentation
