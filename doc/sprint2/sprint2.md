# Sprint2 Meeting and Goal

The goal of sprint2 is to finish up any tasks from both the frontend and backend that are independent from one another, and to complete the initial connection between the two. For the frontend, we are aiming to complete any final views that need to be added to the navbar, as well as working on the general/admin views of the main page so that when we finish connecting the front and back end through the registration and login, we will have all the main required component of the views set up and ready. As for the backend, we will aim to complete setting up user information and storing them in our database, as well as logging all activity and reporting any errors that may occur. The main task for the backend is to create the connection betweenthe two ends, and this will involve registration, logging in/out, application form submission, and application review post submission.
