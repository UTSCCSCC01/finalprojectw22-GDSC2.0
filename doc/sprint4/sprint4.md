# Sprint4 Meeting and Goal

The goal of sprint4 is similiar to that of sprint3, to continue working on connecting the frontend and backend by connecting the views with the database. For the frontend, we are working on completing the admin and general events pages so we can connect them to the backend, as well as any other general cleanup that should be done with the landing page and navbar. As for the backend, we are making sure all the routes are set up for the frontend to connect to, and are working finishing the bug reports and team management for the admin side.
