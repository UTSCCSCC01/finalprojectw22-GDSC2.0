# Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting
- Sahib Nanda
- Dale Rodrigues
- Litao Chen
- Vishay Singh
- Stephan Motha
- Ahmed Al-Mandalawi

## Unfinished Tasks
- We did not have any unfinished tasks from the previous sprint.

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Continuing to work on tasks more frequently instead of cramming at the end of the sprint
- Making sure our committed files are less likely to cause merge conflicts as they take some time to resolve
- Posting all of our standup messages on the same day

## New Practices To Use
- Meet with group members to complete tasks that require connecting components together that are from different ends (frontend, backend)

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Committing changes that overwrite previously committed files without testing as this may cause problems for other components when merging to master

## Best/Worst Experiences 
- Best experience was seeing components from the frontend start to connect with components from the backend
