## Release Goal
For this release, our team is responsible for developing a full-stack web application for gdscutm from scratch, with the help from TAs and GDSC members.

This release will entail creating a fully functional, user friendly and responsive web application that revolutionizes the application process for gdsc utm community projects while also giving users (students/mentors/visitors) a smooth online experience through access to past projects, resources and events. Furthermore, we aim to create an intuitive and centralized admin interface that allows gdscutm admins to better organize website materials for users and more effectively manage community project applications moving forward.
