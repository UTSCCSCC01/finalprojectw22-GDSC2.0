# Sprint1 Meeting and Goal

The goal of sprint1 is to create the structure for both the frontend and backend so that in sprint 2-4 we can focus on connecting the two and build off of them where needed. For the frontend, we are working with React and our top priority is to create at least a static webpage for each of the major components, ideally the login/signup pages, student/mentor applications, and the events/projects page, as well as creating the navbar to link all the pages together. If we are able to complete our highest priority task, then working on the lower priority pages, adding functionality to the pages, and connecting them to the backend would be our next step. As for the backend, our top priorities are to set up our databse using MongoDB to store the user information, as well as setting up the backend login using Node and Express. For the majority of sprint1 we will assume the frontend and backend are connected and working so we can focus on implementing them separately while assuming the other is fully functional, and we will begin to connect the two if we have time.
