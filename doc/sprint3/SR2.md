# Sprint 2 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting
- Sahib Nanda
- Dale Rodrigues
- Litao Chen
- Vishay Singh
- Stephan Motha
- Ahmed Al-Mandalawi

## Unfinished Tasks
- We did not have any unfinished tasks from the previous sprint.

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Continuing to work on tasks more frequently instead of cramming at the end of the sprint
- Making sure all standup messages from all members are posted on the same day

## New Practices To Use
- Making sure our committed files are less likely to cause merge conflicts as they take some time to resolve

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Working on frontend and backend separately as it is time to connect the two

## Best/Worst Experiences 
- Best experience was being able to complete all assigned tasks for this sprint and being able to demo our documentation
- Worst experience was working to resolve merge conflicts as they became quite tedious
