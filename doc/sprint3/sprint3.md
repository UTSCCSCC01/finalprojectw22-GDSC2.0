# Sprint3 Meeting and Goal

The goal of sprint3 is to continue working on connecting the frontend and backend by connecting the views with the database, and to also work on finishing up any models or components that still need to be completed.  For the frontend, we are working on adding the final components to the general and admin views, and working on storing and retrieving the relevant information in the database. As for the backend, we are working on mentor and team information and storing them in our database, as well as logging all activity and continuing to report any errors that may occur. As we have completed most of the individual components for the frontend and backend separately, we will spend this and the next sprint working on connecting the two.
