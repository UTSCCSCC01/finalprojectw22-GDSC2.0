    <summary><strong>The Project Objective</strong></summary>
    <summary>
        Our project objective is to build a full-stack web application for Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) to help students from all disciplines learn about technology and make their ideas a reality. We hope students will connect with other students and mentors from the GDSC community to work on projects and build software solutions while they continue to learn and grow as developers.

    <summary><strong>The Key Personas</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Mark Webber, a 19-year-old student with experience programming in Java and Python who would like to expand their knowledge about new tech stacks and frameworks, all while learning alongside other undergraduate students with different levels of experience who ultimately share the same passion for technology. Mark would also like to work alongside other students and mentors who share the same interests as him, hoping to apply what he has learned to create projects that directly impact his community</li>
        <li>Franco Demarco, a 35-year-old CS professor who had previously worked as a professional software developer would like to share the knowledge he has learned both inside and outside the classrom with promising students who share the same passion as him. Franco aims to teach the students about devlopment tools and tech stacks he has personally used to get the job done, and professional tips on how to work alongside others in a group environment to efficiently complete real-world projects</li>

    <summary><strong>The Key Scenarios</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li>A student has little experience working with web applications but would like to both sharpen their skills and work alongside a team on a community project. By filling out a form on the website this student can meet other aspiring developers looking to work on a community project using the same tech stack they are currently learning</li>
        <li>A TA who has just helped finish teaching a web development course would like to extend their mentorship onto a group of bright individuals looking to create a project but are unsure where to start. By signing up as a mentor this person now has the opportunity to lead the students by sharing their educational and teaching experience with them</li>
    </ul>

    <summary><strong>The Key Principles</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li><b>UI is simple to use</b> - The design should be simple enough for all users to indicate where their interests are and succeed in finding fellow users who share the same passion as them</li>
        <li><b>All students are welcome</b>Students with little experience in software development should not feel intimidated by the UI as they are encouraged to learn and work alongside other students and mentors since GDSC is a club for all users</li>
        <li><b>All users have access to club information</b> - All types of users have access to all the information on the GDSC website, for example being able to view all past, present, and future events, or current and archived community projects</li>
    </ul>
