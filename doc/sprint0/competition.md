<summary><strong>Google Forms</strong></summary>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.ca/forms/about/"/>Google Forms</a> provides an interface for users to setup free surveys and view/process inputted data</li>
    <li>Google forms is a competitor for our integrated student portal</li>
    <li>Our integrated student portal is a better alternative for users filling out the form as it allows for a more customizable UI which is more aesthetically pleasing, thus it can attract more students</li>
    <li>Our integrated student portal is a better alternative for admins viewing the submitted forms as it allows for more customizable backend functionality such as approving/rejecting, custom admin UI and a centralized interface for all admin functionality, as opposed to google forms</li>
    <li>We believe that Google forms did not focus on adding the customizability that we intend to have as they hoped to produce a generic survey platform that is usable by as many people as possibe. Adding more custom features would be either unnecessary or could take away from the product reaching more people </li>
    <li>If Google forms wanted to add a more customizable interface, they would have to implement many more customizable components of the form, such as using a custom domain, animations etc. </li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Survey Monkey</strong></summary>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/"/>SurveyMonkey</a> is a platform similar to google forms that allows users to create surveys and analyse results</li>
    <li>SurveyMonkey is another competitor for our integrated student portal</li>
    <li>Our integrated student portal is a better alternative for users filling out the form as it allows for a more customizable UI, similar to google forms. Survey monkey does not allow for custom CSS or inserting images/videos</li>
    <li>Our integrated student portal is a better alternative for admins viewing the submitted forms as SurveyMonkey works on a freemium business model. Thus, advanced features to view and process data come with paid plans which may not be ideal</li>
    <li>We believe that SurveyMonkey implemented the freemium business because they wanted to ensure while members can use their products, if they want more features, SurveyMonkey can still make active income</li>
    <li>If SurveyMonkey wanted to add a more accessible platform, they could remove the premium paywall, however, this may not be ideal for their business </li>
</ul>

    <summary><strong>UTM CSSC</strong></summary>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://cssc.utm.utoronto.ca/"/>UTM CSSC</a> is a website that provides academic and professional resources for MCS students</li>
        <li>UTM CSSC is not a direct competitor as both UTM CSSC and GDSC UTM serve two different purpose, however they are similar in a few ways when comparing visitor/student usage</li>
        <li>The GDSC UTM website is a better alternative for a visitor/student as it provides more specific resources for students who want access to past workshops/event relating to GDSC</li>
        <li>If UTM CSSC wanted to add more specific resources on their own site, they would have to integrate club specific data and info without having external links to other domains. However, this is unnecessary and not in the scope of their website</li>
    </ul>
